<h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">Order of evaluation</h1>            <p>Order of evaluation of the operands of almost all C++ operators (including the order of evaluation of function arguments in a function-call expression and the order of evaluation of the subexpressions within any expression) is unspecified. The compiler can evaluate operands in any order, and may choose another order when the same expression is evaluated again.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to this rule which are noted below.</p>
<p>Except where noted below, there is no concept of left-to-right or right-to-left evaluation in C++. This is not to be confused with left-to-right and right-to-left associativity of operators: the expression <code>f1() + f2() + f3()</code> is parsed as <code>(f1() + f2()) + f3()</code> due to left-to-right associativity of operator+, but the function call to <code>f3</code> may be evaluated first, last, or between <code>f1()</code> or <code>f2()</code> at run time.</p>

</h2> <h3 id="Definitions"> Definitions</h3> <h4 id="Evaluation_of_Expressions"> Evaluation of Expressions</h4> <p>Evaluation of each expression includes:</p>
<ul>
<li> <i>value computations</i>: calculation of the value that is returned by the expression. This may involve determination of the identity of the object (glvalue evaluation, e.g. if the expression returns a reference to some object) or reading the value previously assigned to an object (prvalue evaluation, e.g. if the expression returns a number, or some other value) </li>
<li> Initiation of <i>side effects</i>: access (read or write) to an object designated by a volatile glvalue, modification (writing) to an object, calling a library I/O function, or calling a function that does any of those operations. </li>
</ul> <h4 id="Ordering"> Ordering</h4> <p>"sequenced-before" is an asymmetric, transitive, pair-wise relationship between evaluations within the same thread.</p>
<ul>
<li> If A is sequenced before B, then evaluation of A will be complete before evaluation of B begins. </li>
<li> If A is not sequenced before B and B is sequenced before A, then evaluation of B will be complete before evaluation of A begins. </li>
<li> If A is not sequenced before B and B is not sequenced before A, then two possibilities exist: <ul>
<li> evaluations of A and B are unsequenced: they may be performed in any order and may overlap (within a single thread of execution, the compiler may interleave the CPU instructions that comprise A and B) </li>
<li> evaluations of A and B are indeterminately sequenced: they may be performed in any order but may not overlap: either A will be complete before B, or B will be complete before A. The order may be the opposite the next time the same expression is evaluated. </li>

<p>A <i>sequence point</i> is a point in the execution sequence where all side effects from the previous evaluations in the sequence are complete, and no side effects of the subsequent evaluations started.</p>
<h3 id="Rules_2"> Rules</h3> <p>1) There is a sequence point at the end of each full expression (typically, at the semicolon).</p>
<p>2) When calling a function (whether or not the function is inline and whether or not function call syntax was used), there is a sequence point after the evaluation of all function arguments (if any) which takes place before execution of any expressions or statements in the function body.</p>
<p>3) There is a sequence point after the copying of a returned value of a function and before the execution of any expressions outside the function.</p>
<p>4) Once the execution of a function begins, no expressions from the calling function are evaluated until execution of the called function has completed (functions cannot be interleaved).</p>
<p>5) In the evaluation of each of the following four expressions, using the built-in (non-overloaded) operators, there is a sequence point after the evaluation of the expression <code>a</code>.</p>
