<h1 id="the-dependency-injection-pattern">The Dependency Injection pattern</h1> <p><strong>Dependency injection</strong> is an important application design pattern. It's used so widely that almost everyone just calls it <em>DI</em>.</p> <p>Angular has its own dependency injection framework, and you really can't build an Angular application without it.</p> <p>This page covers what DI is and why it's useful.</p> <p>When you've learned the general pattern, you're ready to turn to the <a href="../dependency-injection/">Angular Dependency Injection</a> guide to see how it works in an Angular app.</p>  <h2 id="why-dependency-injection">Why dependency injection?</h2> <p>To understand why dependency injection is so important, consider an example without it. Imagine writing the following code:</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/car/car.ts (without DI)</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">export class Car {

  public engine: Engine;
  public tires: Tires;
  public description = 'No DI';

  constructor() {
    this.engine = new Engine();
    this.tires = new Tires();
  }

  // Method using the engine and tires
  drive() {
    return `${this.description} car with ` +
      `${this.engine.cylinders} cylinders and ${this.tires.make} tires.`;
  }
}</pre> <p>The <code>Car</code> class creates everything it needs inside its constructor. What's the problem? The problem is that the <code>Car</code> class is brittle, inflexible, and hard to test.</p> <p>This <code>Car</code> needs an engine and tires. Instead of asking for them, the <code>Car</code> constructor instantiates its own copies from the very specific classes <code>Engine</code> and <code>Tires</code>.</p> <p>What if the <code>Engine</code> class evolves and its constructor requires a parameter? That would break the <code>Car</code> class and it would stay broken until you rewrote it along the lines of <code>this.engine = new Engine(theNewParameter)</code>. The <code>Engine</code> constructor parameters weren't even a consideration when you first wrote <code>Car</code>. You may not anticipate them even now. But you'll <em>have</em> to start caring because when the definition of <code>Engine</code> changes, the <code>Car</code> class must change. That makes <code>Car</code> brittle.</p> <p>What if you want to put a different brand of tires on your <code>Car</code>? Too bad. You're locked into whatever brand the <code>Tires</code> class creates. That makes the <code>Car</code> class inflexible.</p> <p>Right now each new car gets its own <code>engine</code>. It can't share an <code>engine</code> with other cars. While that makes sense for an automobile engine, surely you can think of other dependencies that should be shared, such as the onboard wireless connection to the manufacturer's service center. This <code>Car</code> lacks the flexibility to share services that have been created previously for other consumers.</p> <p>When you write tests for <code>Car</code> you're at the mercy of its hidden dependencies. Is it even possible to create a new <code>Engine</code> in a test environment? What does <code>Engine</code> depend upon? What does that dependency depend on? Will a new instance of <code>Engine</code> make an asynchronous call to the server? You certainly don't want that going on during tests.</p> <p>What if the <code>Car</code> should flash a warning signal when tire pressure is low? How do you confirm that it actually does flash a warning if you can't swap in low-pressure tires during the test?</p> <p>You have no control over the car's hidden dependencies. When you can't control the dependencies, a class becomes difficult to test.</p> <p>How can you make <code>Car</code> more robust, flexible, and testable?</p>  <p>That's super easy. Change the <code>Car</code> constructor to a version with DI:</p> <code-tabs> <div class="pre-title">src/app/car/car.ts (excerpt with DI)</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">public description = 'DI';

constructor(public engine: Engine, public tires: Tires) { }</pre> <div class="pre-title">src/app/car/car.ts (excerpt without DI)</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">public engine: Engine;
public tires: Tires;
public description = 'No DI';

constructor() {
  this.engine = new Engine();
  this.tires = new Tires();
}</pre> </code-tabs> <p>See what happened? The definition of the dependencies are now in the constructor. The <code>Car</code> class no longer creates an <code>engine</code> or <code>tires</code>. It just consumes them.</p> <blockquote class="l-sub-section"> <p>This example leverages TypeScript's constructor syntax for declaring parameters and properties simultaneously.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now you can create a car by passing the engine and tires to the constructor.</p> <pre data-language="typescript">// Simple car with 4 cylinders and Flintstone tires.
let car = new Car(new Engine(), new Tires());</pre> <p>How cool is that? The definition of the <code>engine</code> and <code>tire</code> dependencies are decoupled from the <code>Car</code> class. You can pass in any kind of <code>engine</code> or <code>tires</code> you like, as long as they conform to the general API requirements of an <code>engine</code> or <code>tires</code>.</p> <p>Now, if someone extends the <code>Engine</code> class, that is not <code>Car</code>'s problem.</p> <blockquote class="l-sub-section"> <p>The <em>consumer</em> of <code>Car</code> has the problem. The consumer must update the car creation code to something like this:</p> <pre data-language="typescript">class Engine2 {
  constructor(public cylinders: number) { }
}
// Super car with 12 cylinders and Flintstone tires.
let bigCylinders = 12;
let car = new Car(new Engine2(bigCylinders), new Tires());</pre> <p>The critical point is this: the <code>Car</code> class did not have to change. You'll take care of the consumer's problem shortly.</p> </blockquote> <p>The <code>Car</code> class is much easier to test now because you are in complete control of its dependencies. You can pass mocks to the constructor that do exactly what you want them to do during each test:</p> <pre data-language="typescript">class MockEngine extends Engine { cylinders = 8; }
class MockTires  extends Tires  { make = 'YokoGoodStone'; }

// Test car with 8 cylinders and YokoGoodStone tires.
let car = new Car(new MockEngine(), new MockTires());</pre> <p><strong>You just learned what dependency injection is</strong>.</p> <p>It's a coding pattern in which a class receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself.</p> <p>Cool! But what about that poor consumer? Anyone who wants a <code>Car</code> must now create all three parts: the <code>Car</code>, <code>Engine</code>, and <code>Tires</code>. The <code>Car</code> class shed its problems at the consumer's expense. You need something that takes care of assembling these parts.</p> <p>You <em>could</em> write a giant class to do that:</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/car/car-factory.ts</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">import { Engine, Tires, Car } from './car';

// BAD pattern!
export class CarFactory {
  createCar() {
    let car = new Car(this.createEngine(), this.createTires());
    car.description = 'Factory';
    return car;
  }

  createEngine() {
    return new Engine();
  }

  createTires() {
    return new Tires();
  }
}</pre> <p>It's not so bad now with only three creation methods. But maintaining it will be hairy as the application grows. This factory is going to become a huge spiderweb of interdependent factory methods!</p> <p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could simply list the things you want to build without having to define which dependency gets injected into what?</p> <p>This is where the dependency injection framework comes into play. Imagine the framework had something called an <em>injector</em>. You register some classes with this injector, and it figures out how to create them.</p> <p>When you need a <code>Car</code>, you simply ask the injector to get it for you and you're good to go.</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/car/car-injector.ts</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">let car = injector.get(Car);</pre> <p>Everyone wins. The <code>Car</code> knows nothing about creating an <code>Engine</code> or <code>Tires</code>. The consumer knows nothing about creating a <code>Car</code>. You don't have a gigantic factory class to maintain. Both <code>Car</code> and consumer simply ask for what they need and the injector delivers.</p> <p>This is what a <strong>dependency injection framework</strong> is all about.</p> <p>Now that you know what dependency injection is and appreciate its benefits, turn to the <a href="../dependency-injection/">Angular Dependency Injection</a> guide to see how it is implemented in Angular.</p>
