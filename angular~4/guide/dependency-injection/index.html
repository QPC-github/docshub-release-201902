<h1 id="dependency-injection">Dependency Injection</h1> <p><strong>Dependency injection</strong> is an important application design pattern. Angular has its own dependency injection framework, and you really can't build an Angular application without it. It's used so widely that almost everyone just calls it <em>DI</em>.</p> <p>This page covers what DI is, why it's so useful, and <a href="../dependency-injection/#angular-di">how to use it</a> in an Angular app.</p> <p>Run the live example.</p>  <h2 id="why-dependency-injection">Why dependency injection?</h2> <p>To understand why dependency injection is so important, consider an example without it. Imagine writing the following code:</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/car/car.ts (without DI)</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">export class Car {

  public engine: Engine;
  public tires: Tires;
  public description = 'No DI';

  constructor() {
    this.engine = new Engine();
    this.tires = new Tires();
  }

  // Method using the engine and tires
  drive() {
    return `${this.description} car with ` +
      `${this.engine.cylinders} cylinders and ${this.tires.make} tires.`;
  }
}</pre> <p>The <code>Car</code> class creates everything it needs inside its constructor. What's the problem? The problem is that the <code>Car</code> class is brittle, inflexible, and hard to test.</p> <p>This <code>Car</code> needs an engine and tires. Instead of asking for them, the <code>Car</code> constructor instantiates its own copies from the very specific classes <code>Engine</code> and <code>Tires</code>.</p> <p>What if the <code>Engine</code> class evolves and its constructor requires a parameter? That would break the <code>Car</code> class and it would stay broken until you rewrote it along the lines of <code>this.engine = new Engine(theNewParameter)</code>. The <code>Engine</code> constructor parameters weren't even a consideration when you first wrote <code>Car</code>. You may not anticipate them even now. But you'll <em>have</em> to start caring because when the definition of <code>Engine</code> changes, the <code>Car</code> class must change. That makes <code>Car</code> brittle.</p> <p>What if you want to put a different brand of tires on your <code>Car</code>? Too bad. You're locked into whatever brand the <code>Tires</code> class creates. That makes the <code>Car</code> class inflexible.</p> <p>Right now each new car gets its own <code>engine</code>. It can't share an <code>engine</code> with other cars. While that makes sense for an automobile engine, surely you can think of other dependencies that should be shared, such as the onboard wireless connection to the manufacturer's service center. This <code>Car</code> lacks the flexibility to share services that have been created previously for other consumers.</p> <p>When you write tests for <code>Car</code> you're at the mercy of its hidden dependencies. Is it even possible to create a new <code>Engine</code> in a test environment? What does <code>Engine</code> depend upon? What does that dependency depend on? Will a new instance of <code>Engine</code> make an asynchronous call to the server? You certainly don't want that going on during tests.</p> <p>What if the <code>Car</code> should flash a warning signal when tire pressure is low? How do you confirm that it actually does flash a warning if you can't swap in low-pressure tires during the test?</p> <p>You have no control over the car's hidden dependencies. When you can't control the dependencies, a class becomes difficult to test.</p> <p>How can you make <code>Car</code> more robust, flexible, and testable?</p>  <p>That's super easy. Change the <code>Car</code> constructor to a version with DI:</p> <code-tabs> <div class="pre-title">src/app/car/car.ts (excerpt with DI)</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">public description = 'DI';

constructor(public engine: Engine, public tires: Tires) { }</pre> <div class="pre-title">src/app/car/car.ts (excerpt without DI)</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">public engine: Engine;
public tires: Tires;
public description = 'No DI';

constructor() {
  this.engine = new Engine();
  this.tires = new Tires();
}</pre> </code-tabs> <p>See what happened? The definition of the dependencies are now in the constructor. The <code>Car</code> class no longer creates an <code>engine</code> or <code>tires</code>. It just consumes them.</p> <blockquote class="l-sub-section"> <p>This example leverages TypeScript's constructor syntax for declaring parameters and properties simultaneously.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now you can create a car by passing the engine and tires to the constructor.</p> <pre data-language="typescript">// Simple car with 4 cylinders and Flintstone tires.
let car = new Car(new Engine(), new Tires());</pre> <p>How cool is that? The definition of the <code>engine</code> and <code>tire</code> dependencies are decoupled from the <code>Car</code> class. You can pass in any kind of <code>engine</code> or <code>tires</code> you like, as long as they conform to the general API requirements of an <code>engine</code> or <code>tires</code>.</p> <p>Now, if someone extends the <code>Engine</code> class, that is not <code>Car</code>'s problem.</p> <blockquote class="l-sub-section"> <p>The <em>consumer</em> of <code>Car</code> has the problem. The consumer must update the car creation code to something like this:</p> <pre data-language="typescript">class Engine2 {
  constructor(public cylinders: number) { }
}
// Super car with 12 cylinders and Flintstone tires.
let bigCylinders = 12;
let car = new Car(new Engine2(bigCylinders), new Tires());</pre> <p>The critical point is this: the <code>Car</code> class did not have to change. You'll take care of the consumer's problem shortly.</p> </blockquote> <p>The <code>Car</code> class is much easier to test now because you are in complete control of its dependencies. You can pass mocks to the constructor that do exactly what you want them to do during each test:</p> <pre data-language="typescript">class MockEngine extends Engine { cylinders = 8; }
class MockTires  extends Tires  { make = 'YokoGoodStone'; }

// Test car with 8 cylinders and YokoGoodStone tires.
let car = new Car(new MockEngine(), new MockTires());</pre> <p><strong>You just learned what dependency injection is</strong>.</p> <p>It's a coding pattern in which a class receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself.</p> <p>Cool! But what about that poor consumer? Anyone who wants a <code>Car</code> must now create all three parts: the <code>Car</code>, <code>Engine</code>, and <code>Tires</code>. The <code>Car</code> class shed its problems at the consumer's expense. You need something that takes care of assembling these parts.</p> <p>You <em>could</em> write a giant class to do that:</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/car/car-factory.ts</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">import { Engine, Tires, Car } from './car';

// BAD pattern!
export class CarFactory {
  createCar() {
    let car = new Car(this.createEngine(), this.createTires());
    car.description = 'Factory';
    return car;
  }

  createEngine() {
    return new Engine();
  }

  createTires() {
    return new Tires();
  }
}</pre> <p>It's not so bad now with only three creation methods. But maintaining it will be hairy as the application grows. This factory is going to become a huge spiderweb of interdependent factory methods!</p> <p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could simply list the things you want to build without having to define which dependency gets injected into what?</p> <p>This is where the dependency injection framework comes into play. Imagine the framework had something called an <em>injector</em>. You register some classes with this injector, and it figures out how to create them.</p> <p>When you need a <code>Car</code>, you simply ask the injector to get it for you and you're good to go.</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/car/car-injector.ts</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">let car = injector.get(Car);</pre> <p>Everyone wins. The <code>Car</code> knows nothing about creating an <code>Engine</code> or <code>Tires</code>. The consumer knows nothing about creating a <code>Car</code>. You don't have a gigantic factory class to maintain. Both <code>Car</code> and consumer simply ask for what they need and the injector delivers.</p> <p>This is what a <strong>dependency injection framework</strong> is all about.</p> <p>Now that you know what dependency injection is and appreciate its benefits, read on to see how it is implemented in Angular.</p>  <h2 id="angular-dependency-injection">Angular dependency injection</h2> <p>Angular ships with its own dependency injection framework. This framework can also be used as a standalone module by other applications and frameworks.</p> <p>To see what it can do when building components in Angular, start with a simplified version of the <code>HeroesComponent</code> that from the <a href="../../tutorial/">The Tour of Heroes</a>.</p> <code-tabs> <div class="pre-title">src/app/heroes/heroes.component.ts</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">import { Component }          from '@angular/core';

This stripped down version has only one child, <code>HeroListComponent</code>, which displays a list of heroes.</p> <p>Right now <code>HeroListComponent</code> gets heroes from <code>HEROES</code>, an in-memory collection defined in another file. That may suffice in the early stages of development, but it's far from ideal. As soon as you try to test this component or want to get your heroes data from a remote server, you'll have to change the implementation of <code>heroes</code> and fix every other use of the <code>HEROES</code> mock data.</p> <p>It's better to make a service that hides how the app gets hero data.</p> <blockquote class="l-sub-section"> <p>Given that the service is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" target="_blank">separate concern</a>, consider writing the service code in its own file.</p> <p>See <a href="../dependency-injection/#one-class-per-file">this note</a> for details.</p> </blockquote> <p>The following <code>HeroService</code> exposes a <code>getHeroes</code> method that returns the same mock data as before, but none of its consumers need to know that.</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/heroes/hero.service.ts</div>

If the app were actually getting data from a remote server, the API would have to be asynchronous, perhaps returning a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise" target="_blank">Promise</a>. You'd also have to rewrite the way components consume the service. This is important in general, but not in this example.</p> </blockquote> <p>A service is nothing more than a class in Angular.

You <em>could</em> write code that <a href="../dependency-injection/#explicit-injector">explicitly creates an injector</a> if you <em>had</em> to, but it's not always the best choice. Angular takes care of creating and calling injectors when it creates components for you—whether through HTML markup, as in <code>&lt;hero-list&gt;&lt;/hero-list&gt;</code>, or after navigating to a component with the <a href="../router/">router</a>. If you let Angular do its job, you'll enjoy the benefits of automated dependency injection.</p>  <h3 id="singleton-services">Singleton services</h3> <p>Dependencies are singletons within the scope of an injector.

<pre data-language="typescript">providers: [Logger]</pre> <p>If you forget to register the logger, Angular throws an exception when it first looks for the logger:</p> <pre format="nocode">EXCEPTION: No provider for Logger!

It needed that provider to create a <code>Logger</code> to inject into a new <code>HeroService</code>, which it needed to create and inject into a new <code>HeroListComponent</code>.</p> <p>The chain of creations started with the <code>Logger</code> provider. <em>Providers</em> are the subject of the next section.</p>  <h2 id="injector-providers">Injector providers</h2> <p>A provider <em>provides</em> the concrete, runtime version of a dependency value. The injector relies on <strong>providers</strong> to create instances of the services that the injector injects into components and other services.</p> <p>You must register a service <em>provider</em> with the injector, or it won't know how to create the service.</p> <p>Earlier you registered the <code>Logger</code> service in the <code>providers</code> array of the metadata for the <code>AppModule</code> like this:</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/providers.component.ts</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">providers: [Logger]</pre> <p>There are many ways to <em>provide</em> something that looks and behaves like a <code>Logger</code>. The <code>Logger</code> class itself is an obvious and natural provider. But it's not the only way.</p> <p>You can configure the injector with alternative providers that can deliver an object that behaves like a <code>Logger</code>. You could provide a substitute class. You could provide a logger-like object. You could give it a provider that calls a logger factory function. Any of these approaches might be a good choice under the right circumstances.</p> <p>What matters is that the injector has a provider to go to when it needs a <code>Logger</code>.</p>  <h3 id="the-provider-class-and-provide-object-literal">The <code>Provider</code> class and <code>provide</code> object literal</h3> <p>You wrote the <code>providers</code> array like this:</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/providers.component.ts</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">providers: [Logger]</pre> <p>This is actually a shorthand expression for a provider registration using a <em>provider</em> object literal with two properties:</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/providers.component.ts</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">[{ provide: Logger, useClass: Logger }]</pre> <p>The first is the <a href="../dependency-injection/#token">token</a> that serves as the key for both locating a dependency value and registering the provider.</p> <p>The second is a provider definition object, which you can think of as a <em>recipe</em> for creating the dependency value. There are many ways to create dependency values just as there are many ways to write a recipe.</p>  <h3 id="alternative-class-providers">Alternative class providers</h3> <p>Occasionally you'll ask a different class to provide the service.

<pre data-language="typescript">[{ provide: Logger, useClass: BetterLogger }]</pre>  <h3 id="class-provider-with-dependencies">Class provider with dependencies</h3> <p>Maybe an <code>EvenBetterLogger</code> could display the user name in the log message.

The <code>OldLogger</code> should be an alias for <code>NewLogger</code>.</p> <p>You certainly do not want two different <code>NewLogger</code> instances in your app. Unfortunately, that's what you get if you try to alias <code>OldLogger</code> to <code>NewLogger</code> with <code>useClass</code>.</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/providers.component.ts</div>

Maybe the information changes repeatedly in the course of the browser session.</p> <p>Suppose also that the injectable service has no independent access to the source of this information.</p> <p>This situation calls for a <strong>factory provider</strong>.</p> <p>To illustrate the point, add a new business requirement: the <code>HeroService</code> must hide <em>secret</em> heroes from normal users. Only authorized users should see secret heroes.</p> <p>Like the <code>EvenBetterLogger</code>, the <code>HeroService</code> needs a fact about the user. It needs to know if the user is authorized to see secret heroes. That authorization can change during the course of a single application session, as when you log in a different user.</p> <p>Unlike <code>EvenBetterLogger</code>, you can't inject the <code>UserService</code> into the <code>HeroService</code>. The <code>HeroService</code> won't have direct access to the user information to decide who is authorized and who is not.</p> <p>Instead, the <code>HeroService</code> constructor takes a boolean flag to control display of secret heroes.</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/heroes/hero.service.ts (excerpt)</div>

  this.logger.log(`Getting heroes for ${auth} user.`);
  return HEROES.filter(hero =&gt; this.isAuthorized || !hero.isSecret);
}</pre> <p>You can inject the <code>Logger</code>, but you can't inject the boolean <code>isAuthorized</code>. You'll have to take over the creation of new instances of this <code>HeroService</code> with a factory provider.</p> <p>A factory provider needs a factory function:</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/heroes/hero.service.provider.ts (excerpt)</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">let heroServiceFactory = (logger: Logger, userService: UserService) =&gt; {
  return new HeroService(logger, userService.user.isAuthorized);
};</pre> <p>Although the <code>HeroService</code> has no access to the <code>UserService</code>, the factory function does.</p> <p>You inject both the <code>Logger</code> and the <code>UserService</code> into the factory provider and let the injector pass them along to the factory function:</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/heroes/hero.service.provider.ts (excerpt)</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">export let heroServiceProvider =
  { provide: HeroService,
    useFactory: heroServiceFactory,
    deps: [Logger, UserService]
  };</pre> <blockquote class="l-sub-section"> <p>The <code>useFactory</code> field tells Angular that the provider is a factory function whose implementation is the <code>heroServiceFactory</code>.</p> <p>The <code>deps</code> property is an array of <a href="../dependency-injection/#token">provider tokens</a>. The <code>Logger</code> and <code>UserService</code> classes serve as tokens for their own class providers. The injector resolves these tokens and injects the corresponding services into the matching factory function parameters.</p> </blockquote> <p>Notice that you captured the factory provider in an exported variable, <code>heroServiceProvider</code>. This extra step makes the factory provider reusable. You can register the <code>HeroService</code> with this variable wherever you need it.</p> <p>In this sample, you need it only in the <code>HeroesComponent</code>, where it replaces the previous <code>HeroService</code> registration in the metadata <code>providers</code> array. Here you see the new and the old implementation side-by-side:</p> <code-tabs> <div class="pre-title">src/app/heroes/heroes.component (v3)</div>

  `
})
export class HeroesComponent { }</pre> </code-tabs>  <h2 id="dependency-injection-tokens">Dependency injection tokens</h2> <p>When you register a provider with an injector, you associate that provider with a dependency injection token. The injector maintains an internal <em>token-provider</em> map that it references when asked for a dependency. The token is the key to the map.</p> <p>In all previous examples, the dependency value has been a class <em>instance</em>, and the class <em>type</em> served as its own lookup key. Here you get a <code>HeroService</code> directly from the injector by supplying the <code>HeroService</code> type as the token:</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/injector.component.ts</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">heroService: HeroService;</pre> <p>You have similar good fortune when you write a constructor that requires an injected class-based dependency. When you define a constructor parameter with the <code>HeroService</code> class type, Angular knows to inject the service associated with that <code>HeroService</code> class token:</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/heroes/hero-list.component.ts</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">constructor(heroService: HeroService)</pre> <p>This is especially convenient when you consider that most dependency values are provided by classes.</p>  <h3 id="non-class-dependencies">Non-class dependencies</h3> <p> What if the dependency value isn't a class? Sometimes the thing you want to inject is a string, function, or object. </p> <p> Applications often define configuration objects with lots of small facts (like the title of the application or the address of a web API endpoint) but these configuration objects aren't always instances of a class. They can be object literals such as this one: </p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/app-config.ts (excerpt)</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">export interface AppConfig {
  apiEndpoint: string;
  title: string;
}

export const HERO_DI_CONFIG: AppConfig = {
  apiEndpoint: 'api.heroes.com',
  title: 'Dependency Injection'
};</pre> <p>What if you'd like to make this configuration object available for injection? You know you can register an object with a <a href="../dependency-injection/#value-provider">value provider</a>.</p> <p>But what should you use as the token? You don't have a class to serve as a token. There is no <code>AppConfig</code> class.</p> <blockquote class="l-sub-section"> <h4 id="typescript-interfaces-arent-valid-tokens">TypeScript interfaces aren't valid tokens</h4> <p>The <code>HERO_DI_CONFIG</code> constant has an interface, <code>AppConfig</code>. Unfortunately, you cannot use a TypeScript interface as a token:</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/providers.component.ts</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">// FAIL! Can't use interface as provider token
[{ provide: AppConfig, useValue: HERO_DI_CONFIG })]</pre> <div class="pre-title">src/app/providers.component.ts</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">// FAIL! Can't inject using the interface as the parameter type
constructor(private config: AppConfig){ }</pre> <p>That seems strange if you're used to dependency injection in strongly typed languages, where an interface is the preferred dependency lookup key.</p> <p>It's not Angular's doing. An interface is a TypeScript design-time artifact. JavaScript doesn't have interfaces. The TypeScript interface disappears from the generated JavaScript. There is no interface type information left for Angular to find at runtime.</p> </blockquote>  <h3 id="injectiontoken"><code>InjectionToken</code></h3> <p>One solution to choosing a provider token for non-class dependencies is to define and use an <a href="../../api/core/injectiontoken/"><em>InjectionToken</em></a>. The definition of such a token looks like this:</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/app.config.ts</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">import { InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';

export let APP_CONFIG = new InjectionToken&lt;AppConfig&gt;('app.config');</pre> <p>The type parameter, while optional, conveys the dependency's type to developers and tooling. The token description is another developer aid.</p> <p>Register the dependency provider using the <code><a href="../../api/core/injectiontoken/" class="code-anchor">InjectionToken</a></code> object:</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/providers.component.ts</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">providers: [{ provide: APP_CONFIG, useValue: HERO_DI_CONFIG }]</pre> <p>Now you can inject the configuration object into any constructor that needs it, with the help of an <code>@<a href="../../api/core/inject/" class="code-anchor">Inject</a></code> decorator:</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/app.component.ts</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">constructor(@Inject(APP_CONFIG) config: AppConfig) {
  this.title = config.title;
}</pre> <blockquote class="l-sub-section"> <p>Although the <code>AppConfig</code> interface plays no role in dependency injection, it supports typing of the configuration object within the class.</p> </blockquote> <p>Alternatively, you can provide and inject the configuration object in an ngModule like <code>AppModule</code>.</p> <div class="pre-title">src/app/app.module.ts (ngmodule-providers)</div>
<pre data-language="typescript">providers: [
  UserService,
  { provide: APP_CONFIG, useValue: HERO_DI_CONFIG }
],</pre>  <h2 id="optional-dependencies">Optional dependencies</h2> <p>The <code>HeroService</code> <em>requires</em> a <code>Logger</code>, but what if it could get by without a <code>logger</code>? You can tell Angular that the dependency is optional by annotating the constructor argument with <code>@<a href="../../api/core/optional/" class="code-anchor">Optional</a>()</code>:</p> <pre data-language="typescript">import { Optional } from '@angular/core';</pre> <pre data-language="typescript">constructor(@Optional() private logger: Logger) {
  if (this.logger) {
    this.logger.log(some_message);
  }
}</pre> <p>When using <code>@<a href="../../api/core/optional/" class="code-anchor">Optional</a>()</code>, your code must be prepared for a null value. If you don't register a <code>logger</code> somewhere up the line, the injector will set the value of <code>logger</code> to null.</p> <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <p>You learned the basics of Angular dependency injection in this page. You can register various kinds of providers, and you know how to ask for an injected object (such as a service) by adding a parameter to a constructor.</p> <p>Angular dependency injection is more capable than this guide has described.

You can call <code>get()</code> with a second parameter, which is the value to return if the service is not found. Angular can't find the service if it's not registered with this or any ancestor injector.</p> <blockquote class="l-sub-section"> <p>The technique is an example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern" target="_blank">service locator pattern</a>.</p> <p><strong>Avoid</strong> this technique unless you genuinely need it. It encourages a careless grab-bag approach such as you see here. It's difficult to explain, understand, and test. You can't know by inspecting the constructor what this class requires or what it will do. It could acquire services from any ancestor component, not just its own.
